</p>
<p>
Once you have successfully downloaded ProtonVPN onto your Remote Desktop, proceed to sign in to Proton VPN using the username and password you created during the sign-up process for your free account.

<h2>Connect to a VPN</h2>

Ensure that you have successfully established a VPN connection to the desired server, in this case, Japan. Once connected, your internet traffic will be routed through the Proton VPN server located in Japan.

Instead of your traffic going directly to its original Azure VM location, it will now pass through the Proton VPN server, providing you with the benefits of anonymity and a geographically shifted online presence. By connecting to a VPN server in a different country, you can route your internet traffic through that server, enhancing privacy and potentially accessing region-restricted content.

<h2>Check your Proton VPN IPv4 address</h2>

</p>
<p>
To verify the IPv4 address associated with your new VPN connection, follow these steps:

Open a web browser and navigate to "whatismyipaddress.com." Once on the web page, you can check your IPv4 address for the new VPN connection. If you are already on the web page, simply click the "Refresh" or "Reload" button, and you will observe your IPv4 address change, along with a shift in the detected country associated with your VPN connection.

</p>
<p>
Open your web browser and navigate to www.google.com. Upon doing so, you will notice that the web page is displayed in Japanese, which is a fascinating experience. This setup involves connecting to a Virtual Machine (VM) from the United States, which had a locale set to India, and from that VM, connecting to a VPN server with a locale in Japan. As a result, all of your online browsing activities now reflect a locale associated with Japan, creating a unique and immersive browsing experience.
