<p>
Connect to a VPN taht is outside of your country. For the example above I connceted to a Japan VPN server. Now taht you are conncet, instead of your traffic goingstraigh to the its orginal azzure VM location; it's going to go to your Proton VPN server.

<h2>Check your Proton VPN IPv4 address</h2>

<p>
Go to whatismyipadress.com to check the IPv4 adress for your new VPN connection. If you are already on the web page just click refesh and you will see your new IPv4 adress and country change.

</p>
<p>
Pull up your web browser and go to www.google.com. Now, you wee see that your web page will be in Japanese whci is really cool. So, we connected to a VM(virtual Machine) from the states, which had a locale in India and from that VM we connected to a VPN that has a locale in Japan. Now, all of our browsing has a locale from Japan
